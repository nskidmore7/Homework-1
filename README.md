# Homework-1
Code Refractor
The object of the assignment was to change the coding of the website to be easier to read when debugging while not changing the layout and functionality of the website. 

I made changes in the tags of the html file, the first change I made was changing the div tag with the class of header into header as well. I then changed the div tag of the footer into the footer. 
I switched the tag of the main body of text under the photo to main while changing the tag of the text to the side into side bar.
I also organized the H tags into a numerical order by each section which makes it easier for me to tell where I was at in the code, and what I was working on.
The readme also talked about making websites accessible for people with disabilities, so I added titles to the photos so when a blind person looks at our website their reader will be able to tell them what the photos are.
